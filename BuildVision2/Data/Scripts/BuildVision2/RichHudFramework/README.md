# Rich Hud Framework
When it comes to creating custom GUI in Space Engineers, you don't have a lot to work with. With the tools supplied by the modding API, you can send notifications, you can send chat messages, create popups, really basic stuff. If you're so inclined, you can rearrange and reformat the HUD itself, but what if you want to create something totally new?

Well, with Billboards you can draw polygons pretty much wherever you want in world space, and with a bit of math you can figure out how to get them to stick to the screen, and with a bit more fiddling still, you can figure out how to size and place them with pixel-perfect accuracy. 

And by the time you've finally figured out how all that works, a week has probably gone by. Fortunately, the Text HUD API can help there. It already has specialized Billboards for doing exactly that, and as you might have guessed by the name, it'll handle text rendering as well!

With a little trial and error, you'll be able to figure out how to size and position everything, and at that point, you'll essentially have a bunch of colored rectangles and text. It's a start, but it's still not much to work with, and just getting that far will take days to weeks depending on the amount of time you're willing to spend.

Take a look at the window in the screenshot below. No, that's not a new thing they added in the last update. No, it's not a plugin. It's part of a workshop mod. Yeah, it's nothing crazy, but when you consider that the pinnacle of custom UI has essentially been limited to custom HUD layouts and blocks of text with colored backgrounds, well then things start to look a bit different, don't they?
